## Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for the identification of functional neurological disorders: a systematic review with meta-analysis

**Introduction:** Functional Neurological Disorders (FND) manifest as genuine motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms without any identifiable neurological lesion. Diagnosis is now based on positive clinical signs, rather than exclusion. FND is a complex and multifactorial condition, resulting from a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests used to identify FND. These tests, known as index tests, help distinguish FND from organic pathologies, enabling earlier diagnosis and more appropriate managementâ€”particularly in physiotherapy.

**Method:** This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook guidelines, assesses the validity of clinical diagnostic tests for FND. The search strategy was applied across four databases.

**Results:** Fourteen studies (951 participants) were included. The meta-analysis of the Hoover sign was based on six studies (412 participants) and showed a combined sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 96%. For collapsing weakness, four studies (292 participants) gave a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 95%. The results of seven other tests are presented in the form of a Forest plot, and 27 tests are presented individually in a table.

**Discussion & conclusion:** The Hoover sign and collapsing weakness demonstrate low sensitivity but very high specificity. However, methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of studies underscore the need for more rigorous research. The development of standardized protocols would improve test interpretation and support their integration into reliable diagnostic algorithms.

**Key words:** Functional neurological disorder; organic lesion; diagnostic test; diagnostic accuracy; sensitivity; specificity; likelihood ratio; systematic review; meta-analysis; Hoover sign; collapsing weakness.
