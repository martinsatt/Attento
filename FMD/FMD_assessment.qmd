## Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for the identification of functional neurological disorders: a systematic review with meta-analysis

**Introduction:** Functional neurological disorders (FND) manifest as real motor, sensory and cognitive symptoms without any identifiable neurological lesion. Their diagnosis is now based on positive clinical signs. Complex and multifactorial, they result from biological, psychological and social factors. Our study assesses the diagnostic accuracy of tests for identifying NFTs. Clinical tests, known as index tests, make it possible to differentiate NFTs from organic pathologies, facilitating early diagnosis and appropriate management, particularly in physiotherapy.

**Method:** This systematic review with meta-analysis, in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook guidelines, assesses the validity of clinical diagnostic tests for functional neurological disorders. The search strategy was applied to four databases.

**Results:** Fourteen studies (951 participants) were included. The meta-analysis of the Hoover signal was based on six studies (412 participants) and showed a combined sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 96%. For collapsing weakness, four studies (292 participants) gave a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 95%. The results of seven other tests are presented in the form of a Forest plot, and 27 tests are presented individually in a table.

**Discussion & conclusion:** The Hoover sign and Collapsing Weakness have diagnostic performances characterised by low sensitivity and very good specificity. However, methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of studies highlight the need for more rigorous research. Standardised protocols would facilitate the interpretation of these tests and their integration into reliable diagnostic algorithms.

**Key words:** Functional neurological disorder; organic lesion; diagnostic test; diagnostic accuracy; sensitivity; specificity; likelihood ratio; systematic review; meta-analysis; Hoover sign; collapsing weakness.
