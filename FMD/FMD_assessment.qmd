Currently we are working on a systematic review on the accuracy of clinical tests for the diagnosis of functional motor disorders (FMD). Findings of the systematic review will be published here.

In the meantime, a current overview of the assessment of FMD can be found in this paper [@serranov√°2023].

Below you see a video by VJ Neurology on how to diagnose Functional Motor Disorders [@vjneurology2022].
