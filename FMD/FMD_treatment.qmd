Currently, our research group performs a systematic review of rehabilitation interventions for people with functional motor disorders (FMD).

In the meantime, here are core recommendations for physiotherapy treatment in people with FMD. In 2015 an expert group published the following physiotherapy treatment recommendations for people with FMD [@nielsen2015]

Here are some core recommendations:

| Relationship                      | Treatment                      | Assistive devices              |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Build trust                       | Limit "hands on treatment"     | Avoid use of splints           |
| Create expectation of improvement | Foster independence            | Avoid immobilisation of joints |
| Involve family                    | Use "goal directed" apporaches | Avoid adaptive equipment       |
