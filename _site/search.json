    "text": "This is the official website of Project ATTENTO, a research initiative focused on investigating how different types of attentional focus can be applied to improve motor function in individuals with functional motor disorders (FMD).\nBackground and aims\nIndividuals with sensorimotor deficits due to Functional Neurological Disorders (FND), experience real symptoms of sensorimotor deficits (e.g., paralysis, abnormal movements, reduced sensibility) in absence of any typical neurological disease explaining their condition (American Psychiatric Association 2013). FND is one of the most frequent causes of neurological outpatient visits and has important socioeconomic costs (Bermingham et al. 2010; Stephen et al. 2021). Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis is often delayed because it implies the exclusion of other organic pathologies (e.g., stroke). This is a crucial issue since the delay from symptoms’ onset to the diagnosis has been recognized as the most significant negative prognostic factor (Gelauff et al. 2014; Gelauff and Stone 2016). Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify objective and disease-specific markers to support clinicians in their diagnostic routines. \nIn this context, hierarchical Bayesian approach has been proposed as a promising framework to explain sensorimotor symptoms in FND in terms of deficit in the inference process, and specifically in the imbalance between prior knowledge, i.e. top-down information, related to an aberrant focus of attention directed over the body, and bottom-up information, such as sensory perception and multisensory integration (Edwards et al. 2012). Specifically, it has been suggested that sensory perception and multisensory integration occurs properly when the patient’s attention is focused externally (in the environment, or outside the own body), as opposed to when it is directed towards their own body (internally). This aligns with recent expert recommendations for physiotherapy in FND, which emphasize “goal-directed automatic movements” to shift the patient’s attention outward and reduce excessive internal focus of attention (Nielsen et al. 2015).\nDespite this theoretical framework, the idea of “an abnormal sensorimotor processing of information during internal focus of attention” in FND’s has not been thoroughly validated, as no studies have quantitatively assessed this hypothesis. To address this gap, the ATTENTO project aims to: \n\nevaluate the processing of sensorimotor signals and multisensory integration (bottom-up) in FND patients, \n\n\n\nexamine how this process is influenced by internal and external focus of attention (prior \n\nknowledge) \nTo achieve these objectives, an ad hoc multisensory, visuo-proprioceptive perceptual task based on passive movements has been developed.",

    "text": "Introduction: Functional Neurological Disorders (FND) manifest as genuine motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms without any identifiable neurological lesion. Diagnosis is now based on positive clinical signs, rather than exclusion. FND is a complex and multifactorial condition, resulting from a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests used to identify FND. These tests, known as index tests, help distinguish FND from organic pathologies, enabling earlier diagnosis and more appropriate management—particularly in physiotherapy.\nMethod: This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook guidelines, assesses the validity of clinical diagnostic tests for FND. The search strategy was applied across four databases.\nResults: Fourteen studies (951 participants) were included. The meta-analysis of the Hoover sign was based on six studies (412 participants) and showed a combined sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 96%. For collapsing weakness, four studies (292 participants) gave a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 95%. The results of seven other tests are presented in the form of a Forest plot, and 27 tests are presented individually in a table.\nDiscussion & conclusion: The Hoover sign and collapsing weakness demonstrate low sensitivity but very high specificity. However, methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of studies underscore the need for more rigorous research. The development of standardized protocols would improve test interpretation and support their integration into reliable diagnostic algorithms.\nKey words: Functional neurological disorder; organic lesion; diagnostic test; diagnostic accuracy; sensitivity; specificity; likelihood ratio; systematic review; meta-analysis; Hoover sign; collapsing weakness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Poster presented at HES-SO Valais in September 2025",

    "text": "Introduction\nFunctional neurological disorder (FND) is a pathology characterized by motor symptoms that impair daily functioning, even though the nervous system is intact. Multiple rehabilitative interventions targeting motor symptoms in FND have been proposed in recent years. However, there remains an unmet need for a comprehensive review of the proposed interventions to clarify the primary treatment options in the context of interdisciplinary rehabilitation.\nMethod\nA scoping review was conducted to address this need. Articles were selected based on predefined eligibility criteria, including a focus on patients with FND presenting motor symptoms, and the assessment of at least one motor outcome.\nResults\nAs part of this scoping review, 26 studies were included. The identified treatments included interdisciplinary interventions, physiotherapy, psychotherapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The most commonly involved professionals in rehabilitative interventions were physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychotherapists. The most common physiotherapeutic treatments applied for FND rehabilitation comprised motor retraining, patient education and attentional focus redirection. Motor and non-motor symptoms were assessed using various tools such as scales and questionnaires.\nDiscussion\nThis review highlights the importance of interdisciplinary management, both physical and psychological approaches, to treat motor symptoms of FND. The heterogeneity observed in symptom assessment methods underlines the need for standardisation and provides a basis for future research. Given the complexity of FND, a key practical implication is to form interdisciplinary teams specialising in the management of rehabilitation in FND.\nKey words\nFunctional neurological disorder, functional movement disorder, motor symptoms, treatment, rehabilitation, interdisciplinary, physical therapy, assessment\n\n\n\nPoster presented at the HES-SO Valais-Wallis in September 2025",

In recent years, several rehabilitative approaches have been suggested, particularly those targeting motor symptoms. However, despite this growing body of work, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review that consolidates these interventions.

    "text": "Learning motor tasks is crucial in various areas. It begins with children acquiring new skills and extends to individuals training in sports. This includes both recreational athletes and professional athletes who dedicate significant time to improving specific motor skills. Additionally, the acquisition of motor skills is vital in the field of rehabilitation. These individuals are training to regain motor skills to enhance their daily functioning, which may lead to greater independence in daily living.\nThere exist several trainings principles in sport sciences, which can be used to support skill acquisition. Frequently, these are classified as motor learning principles. One of these motor learning principles is the use of different attentional foci. This principles involves that learners can be instructed to focus on different aspects during the preparation and execution of a motor task. The attentional focus principle was originally presented by Wulf et al. (Wulf, HoB, and Prinz 1998).\nTraditionally, there exist two different attentional foci, an external focus of attention (EFA) and an internal focus of attention (IFA). If people use an EFA the attention is focussed on the effects of an movement. As an expample, imagine a football player which is instructed to focus on the ball or goal when shooting a ball.\nDuring an IFA the attention is focussed on the body of a learner. This implies that the football player would be instructed to focus on the foot when shooting a ball.\nThere exists evidence that an EFA is superior to an IFA in specific situations (Chua et al. 2021). However, this is not the case for all populations and all tasks to be learned. This is the reason why we have explored the effectiveness of attentional foci with several systematic reviews.\nWithin this section we present several systematic reviews, which have investigated the effectiveness of different attentional foci in different populations.\n\nThe first study is a systematic review in athletes using this motor learning principle for skill acquisition of sport specific motor skills (Favre-Bulle et al. 2024).\nThe second systematic review investigated this principle in people with parkinson´s disease (Krieg et al., n.d.).\nThe third systematic review investigated different attentional foci in stroke rehabilitation.\nThe last systematic review analysed the effectiveness of different attentional foci in musculoskeletal rehabilitation (i.e. in people after knee injuries).\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nChua, Lee-Kuen, Judith Jimenez-Diaz, Rebecca Lewthwaite, Taewon Kim, and Gabriele Wulf. 2021. “Superiority of External Attentional Focus for Motor Performance and Learning: Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.” Psychological Bulletin 147 (6): 618. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34843301/.\n\n\nFavre-Bulle, Emmanuel, Siri Nyfeler, Chloé Schorderet, Gaia Risso, Michela Bassolino, and Karl Martin Sattelmayer. 2024. “The Effectiveness of Different Attentional Foci on the Acquisition of Sport-Specific Motor Skills in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review with Network Meta-Analysis.” PeerJ 12: e17799. https://peerj.com/articles/17799/.\n\n\nKrieg, Maël, Gaël Christen, Manon Tschopp, Katia Giacomino, Michela Bassolino, and Karl Sattelmayer. n.d. “Evaluation of External Vs.

Next to the traditional external and internal focus of attention we also included a switching focus of attention and a holistic focus of attention.\nA switching focus of attention involves that participants start during the prepartion phase with an internal focus instruction. During the execution of the movement an external focus is used. This might be helpful in situations where an internal focus is difficult to avoid for an initial understanding of the movement task (Aiken and Becker 2022).\nWhen a holistic focus is used, the attention is focussed on the overall sensations and emotions associated with the movement (Abedanzadeh, Becker, and Mousavi 2022).\nAll included interventions are visualised in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The numbers indicate the number of pair-wise comparisons.

Diagnosis is now based on positive clinical signs, rather than exclusion. FND is a complex and multifactorial condition, resulting from a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests used to identify FND. These tests, known as index tests, help distinguish FND from organic pathologies, enabling earlier diagnosis and more appropriate management—particularly in physiotherapy.\nMethod: This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook guidelines, assesses the validity of clinical diagnostic tests for FND. The search strategy was applied across four databases.\nResults: Fourteen studies (951 participants) were included. The meta-analysis of the Hoover sign was based on six studies (412 participants) and showed a combined sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 96%. For collapsing weakness, four studies (292 participants) gave a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 95%. The results of seven other tests are presented in the form of a Forest plot, and 27 tests are presented individually in a table.\nDiscussion & conclusion: The Hoover sign and collapsing weakness demonstrate low sensitivity but very high specificity. However, methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of studies underscore the need for more rigorous research. The development of standardized protocols would improve test interpretation and support their integration into reliable diagnostic algorithms.\nKey words: Functional neurological disorder; organic lesion; diagnostic test; diagnostic accuracy; sensitivity; specificity; likelihood ratio; systematic review; meta-analysis; Hoover sign; collapsing weakness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Poster presented at HES-SO Valais in September 2025",

    "text": "This is the official website of Project ATTENTO, a research initiative focused on investigating how different types of attentional focus can be applied to improve motor function in individuals with functional motor disorders (FMD).\nBackground and aims\nIndividuals with sensorimotor deficits due to Functional Neurological Disorders (FND), experience real symptoms of sensorimotor deficits (e.g., paralysis, abnormal movements, reduced sensibility) in absence of any typical neurological disease explaining their condition (American Psychiatric Association 2013). FND is one of the most frequent causes of neurological outpatient visits and has important socioeconomic costs (Bermingham et al. 2010; Stephen et al. 2021). Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis is often delayed because it implies the exclusion of other organic pathologies (e.g., stroke). This is a crucial issue since the delay from symptoms’ onset to the diagnosis has been recognized as the most significant negative prognostic factor (Gelauff et al. 2014; Gelauff and Stone 2016). Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify objective and disease-specific markers to support clinicians in their diagnostic routines. \nIn this context, hierarchical Bayesian approach has been proposed as a promising framework to explain sensorimotor symptoms in FND in terms of deficit in the inference process, and specifically in the imbalance between prior knowledge, i.e. top-down information, related to an aberrant focus of attention directed over the body, and bottom-up information, such as sensory perception and multisensory integration (Edwards et al. 2012). Specifically, it has been suggested that sensory perception and multisensory integration occurs properly when the patient’s attention is focused externally (in the environment, or outside the own body), as opposed to when it is directed towards their own body (internally). This aligns with recent expert recommendations for physiotherapy in FND, which emphasize “goal-directed automatic movements” to shift the patient’s attention outward and reduce excessive internal focus of attention (Nielsen et al. 2015).\nDespite this theoretical framework, the idea of “an abnormal sensorimotor processing of information during internal focus of attention” in FND’s has not been thoroughly validated, as no studies have quantitatively assessed this hypothesis. To address this gap, the ATTENTO project aims to: \n\nevaluate the processing of sensorimotor signals and multisensory integration (bottom-up) in FND patients, \n\n\n\nexamine how this process is influenced by internal and external focus of attention (prior \n\nknowledge) \nTo achieve these objectives, an ad hoc multisensory, visuo-proprioceptive perceptual task based on passive movements has been developed.",

    "text": "Introduction\nFunctional neurological disorder (FND) is a pathology characterized by motor symptoms that impair daily functioning, even though the nervous system is intact. Multiple rehabilitative interventions targeting motor symptoms in FND have been proposed in recent years. However, there remains an unmet need for a comprehensive review of the proposed interventions to clarify the primary treatment options in the context of interdisciplinary rehabilitation.\nMethod\nA scoping review was conducted to address this need. Articles were selected based on predefined eligibility criteria, including a focus on patients with FND presenting motor symptoms, and the assessment of at least one motor outcome.\nResults\nAs part of this scoping review, 26 studies were included. The identified treatments included interdisciplinary interventions, physiotherapy, psychotherapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The most commonly involved professionals in rehabilitative interventions were physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychotherapists. The most common physiotherapeutic treatments applied for FND rehabilitation comprised motor retraining, patient education and attentional focus redirection. Motor and non-motor symptoms were assessed using various tools such as scales and questionnaires.\nDiscussion\nThis review highlights the importance of interdisciplinary management, both physical and psychological approaches, to treat motor symptoms of FND. The heterogeneity observed in symptom assessment methods underlines the need for standardisation and provides a basis for future research. Given the complexity of FND, a key practical implication is to form interdisciplinary teams specialising in the management of rehabilitation in FND.\nKey words\nFunctional neurological disorder, functional movement disorder, motor symptoms, treatment, rehabilitation, interdisciplinary, physical therapy, assessment\n\n\n\nPoster presented at the HES-SO Valais-Wallis in September 2025",
