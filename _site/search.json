    "text": "Learning motor tasks is crucial in various areas. It begins with children acquiring new skills and extends to individuals training in sports. This includes both recreational athletes and professional athletes who dedicate significant time to improving specific motor skills. Additionally, the acquisition of motor skills is vital in the field of rehabilitation. These individuals are training to regain motor skills to enhance their daily functioning, which may lead to greater independence in daily living.\nThere exist several trainings principles in sport sciences, which can be used to support skill acquisition. Frequently, these are classified as motor learning principles. One of these motor learning principles is the use of different attentional foci. This principles involves that learners can be instructed to focus on different aspects during the preparation and execution of a motor task. The attentional focus principle was originally presented by Wulf et al. (Wulf, HoB, and Prinz 1998).\nTraditionally, there exist two different attentional foci, an external focus of attention (EFA) and an internal focus of attention (IFA). If people use an EFA the attention is focussed on the effects of an movement. As an expample, imagine a football player which is instructed to focus on the ball or goal when shooting a ball.\nDuring an IFA the attention is focussed on the body of a learner. This implies that the football player would be instructed to focus on the foot when shooting a ball.\nThere exists evidence that an EFA is superior to an IFA in specific situations (Chua et al. 2021). However, this is not the case for all populations and all tasks to be learned. This is the reason why we have explored the effectiveness of attentional foci with several systematic reviews.\nWithin this section we present several systematic reviews, which have investigated the effectiveness of different attentional foci in different populations.\n\nThe first study is a systematic review in athletes using this motor learning principle for skill acquisition of sport specific motor skills (Favre-Bulle et al. 2024).\nThe second systematic review investigated this principle in people with parkinson´s disease.\nThe third systematic review investigated different attentional foci in stroke rehabilitation.\nThe last systematic review analysed the effectiveness of different attentional foci in musculoskeletal rehabilitation (i.e. in people after knee injuries).\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nChua, Lee-Kuen, Judith Jimenez-Diaz, Rebecca Lewthwaite, Taewon Kim, and Gabriele Wulf. 2021. “Superiority of External Attentional Focus for Motor Performance and Learning: Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.” Psychological Bulletin 147 (6): 618. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34843301/.\n\n\nFavre-Bulle, Emmanuel, Siri Nyfeler, Chloé Schorderet, Gaia Risso, Michela Bassolino, and Karl Martin Sattelmayer. 2024. “The Effectiveness of Different Attentional Foci on the Acquisition of Sport-Specific Motor Skills in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review with Network Meta-Analysis.” PeerJ 12: e17799. https://peerj.com/articles/17799/.\n\n\nWulf, Gabriele, Markus HoB, and Wolfgang Prinz. 1998. “Instructions for Motor Learning: Differential Effects of Internal Versus External Focus of Attention.” Journal of Motor Behavior 30 (2): 169. https://search.proquest.com/openview/14dcd40c91c18806f2223d31db52cd93/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=35941.",

    "text": "Within this systematic review with network meta-analysis we have investigated the effectiveness of various attentional foci. Next to the traditional external and internal focus of attention we also included a switching focus of attention and a holistic focus of attention.\nA switching focus of attention involves that participants start during the prepartion phase with an internal focus instruction. During the execution of the movement an external focus is used. This might be helpful in situations where an internal focus is difficult to avoid for an initial understanding of the movement task (Aiken and Becker 2022).\nWhen a holistic focus is used, the attention is focussed on the overall sensations and emotions associated with the movement (Abedanzadeh, Becker, and Mousavi 2022).\nAll included interventions are visualised in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The numbers indicate the number of pair-wise comparisons. The following colours were used to indicate comparisons: orange: EFA vs control, yellow: EFA vs holistic focus, blue: EFA vs IFA, black: holistic focus vs IFA, brown: IFA vs switching focus, lilac: EFA vs switching focus. The network is tabulated below each plot in a matrix, with 0 indicating no direct connection between two interventions and 1 indicating a direct connection. Switching f.: switching focus.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe acquisition of motor skills is a key element in many sports. A motor learning principle, which is frequently used to support skill acquisition is the application of different attentional foci. The effectiveness of different attentional foci on performance and the learning of motor skills has been investigated in various sports using randomised controlled trials. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of different attentional foci (such as external (EFA) and internal attentional foci (IFA), but also holistic and switching foci) on the performance and learning of a sport-specific motor task in healthy individuals.\n\n\n\nThis study was a systematic review with network meta-analysis. We followed the Prisma reporting guideline and the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews. Cinahl, Embase, Medline and Cochrane Central were searched for eligible studies. Network meta-analyses were performed for the post-acquisition, retention and transfer test endpoints.\n\n\n\nTwelve studies were included in the review. At post-acquisition an EFA was the most effective intervention compared to the control intervention (SMD: 0.9855; 95% CI [0.4–1.57]; p: 0.001). At the retention and transfer test endpoints, a holistic focus of attention had the highest effectiveness compared to an IFA (SMD 0.75; 95% CI [−0.1 to 1.6]; p: 0.09) and (SMD 1.16; 95% CI [0.47–1.86]; p: 0.001). In Figure 2 the comparative effectiveness of the attentional foci at the post-acquistion endpoint is presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Forest-plot post-acquisition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all three endpoints, we analysed a greater effectiveness of an EFA and holistic focus compared to an IFA Figure 2. Several promising different attentional focus interventions were identified. The largest effects were analysed for a holistic focus. However, only one study used this intervention and therefore there remains uncertainty about the effectiveness. With regard to the inconsistency observed, the analysis at post-acquisition should be interpreted with caution. Modified versions of the EFA were the imagined and the dynamic EFA. Both were only explored in single studies and should therefore be investigated in further follow-up studies that directly compare them.\n\n\n\nThe full text of the paper is available on the PeerJ homepage Paper.\nIf you are interested in our analyses and the code we used please visit this website Documentation.",

    "text": "Evaluation of external vs. internal focus of attention in Parkinson’s disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis during on and off medication states\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an external focus of attention (EFA) versus an internal focus of attention (IFA) on balance, gait, and motor symptom severity in people with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) during both ON and OFF medication states. A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted, including nine studies with 240 subjects. The results showed no significant benefit of either attentional focus over the other for balance, gait, or motor symptom severity in PwPD, regardless of medication state. The choice of attentional focus may be best determined by individual preferences and other personal factors. The findings should be interpreted with caution due to potential bias.\n\nAnalysis of external vs internal focus of attention on balance abilities in people with PD\nThe forest plot shows no difference of either focus of attention on balance abilities regardless the medication status.\n\n\n\nForest plot external vs internal focus on balance abilities in people with PD\n\n\nThe methodological quality ratings of several items revealed important limitations. For example assor blinding was not rated as adequate in most studies.\n\n\n\nMethodological quality of included studies in the systematic review evaluated with the PEDro scale.\n\n\nThe full text of the paper is available on the F1000 homepage Paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
